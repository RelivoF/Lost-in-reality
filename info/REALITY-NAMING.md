# Reality naming schemes

As you enter the Reality you have been chosen (NI2398), you might wonder what thos jumble of letters mean, well the 2 letters at the front represent the base information in that reality, these are explained [here](https://github.com/Inter-Reality-Control-Committee/Lost-in-reality/blob/main/info/naming/LETTERS.md). Then the next number is the sector(there is 100 sub-sectors in a sector), after thay the 2 next numbers are the sub-sectors(there is 9 realities in a sub-sector). That is all. Have a fun time playing Lost in Reality, goodbye...
