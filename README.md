# Lost in reality

Lost in reality is a modpack based on an experiment made by the IRCC (Inter Reality Control Committee). The IRCC is a mysterious organization that has the power to manipulate and control parallel universes, or "realities". They have created an experiment, known as Experiment 114(Lost In Realities), where they have sent millions of people to different realities to see how they adapt and survive. You are one of the people sent to reality NI2398.

The modpack is designed to be a survival experience, with a twist. You will have to adapt to the new reality, and the new world you are in. You will have to find food, build shelter, and protect yourself from the dangers that lurk in the shadows. But you will also have to deal with the mysterious forces that are at work in the reality, and the strange creatures that inhabit it.
